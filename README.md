# Adapted Delayed Divisive Normalization Model for Temporal Dynamics in Cortical Visual Prostheses

This repository supports the MSc thesis:

**Bouwman, G. (2024). The Temporal Dynamics of Phosphenes Generated by Corical Visual Prostheses.**

It provides an adapted version of the model presented in:

**Brands, A. M., Devore, S., Devinsky, O., Doyle, W., Flinker, A., Friedman, D., ... & Groen, I. I. A. (2024). Temporal dynamics of short-term neural adaptation across human visual cortex. PLOS Computational Biology, 20(5), e1012161.**

### Model Overview

This adaptation is tailored to predict neural adaptation over short- and moderate-term periods in response to cortical microstimulation, which is critical for developing cortical visual prostheses capable of providing stable visual perception.

The model extends the original by:
1. **Adding a second divisive normalization stage** to capture fast local dynamics and slow longer-term repetition effects in multi-unit activity (MUA) recorded from early visual cortex with Utah microelectrode arrays.
2. **Using power-law functions** instead of exponential functions to more accurately model responses over repeated stimulations.
