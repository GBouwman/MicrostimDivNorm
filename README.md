and is an adaptation of the model from the paper:

**Brands, A. M., Devore, S., Devinsky, O., Doyle, W., Flinker, A., Friedman, D., ... & Groen, I. I. A. (2024). Temporal dynamics of short-term neural adaptation across human visual cortex. PLOS Computational Biology, 20(5), e1012161.**

adapting it to predict short- and moderate-term neural adaptation to cortical microstimulation, relevant for the development of cortical visual prostheses capable of delivering stable visual information.

The model extends on the original model in two main ways, to capture the neural dynamics of MUA recordings of the early visual cortex, recorded by Utah microelectrode arrays: 
(1) the model is extended to contain two divisive normalization stages, enabling it to capture the more local MUA dynamics and the moderate-term repetition effects. (2) the model employs power laws instead of exponential functions found better suited in capturing the dynamics over many repeated stimuli.
